""" Epidemiology Matlab output module

This module was developed to read and process the output of a matlab 
epidemiology study of the Covid-19 virus. The simulation code is not
specific to that particular virus and neither is this module. 

The matlab simulation saves output in a .mat file using hdf5. The 
classes and functions in this module process the expected output of that
simulation.
